			<p>The Mental Health Association of New York City's Adolescent Skills Centers (ASCs) help youth and young adults with emotional and behavioral challenges make a successful transition to adulthood. ASCs create a supportive environment where youth and young adults are provided with opportunities to advance academically, build social and vocational skills, and gain work experience through internships.  A dedicated staff of case managers, counselors, employment specialists, youth advocates and teachers pride themselves on involving youth as full participants in their own care planning.</p>
			<p>In addition to case managers and vocational specialists, the ASCs employ youth advocates who provide peer supports to the program participants. Through collaboration with the New York City Department of Education, on-site teachers provide instruction to help participants improve literacy and math skills and prepare for the TASC examination. The program's supportive, youth-centered approach is results oriented and has a long history of success serving youth who have obtained their diplomas and gone on to competitive employment or further education.</p>
			<p>P35M provides pre-GED classes at the ASC on Kelly Street for students who are overage and undercredited. Students who successfully complete these courses take the TABE examination. Upon passing this examination, students begin the transition to full-time GED courses at the ASC.</p>
