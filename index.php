					<p>On Dec 12, 2017 Manhattan HS selected students from both Beacon and the main site to attend a NBA Basketball game. These students were rewarded for excellent progress made from September to December. They have progressed in both academics and behavior in the classroom. They enjoyed the Brooklyn Nets play the Washington Wizards, where the kids were able to receive a free shirt for their attendance.</p>
					<p>We hope to have more students on the next reward trip on February 12th, when we attend the Nets Vs Clippers game.</p>
