				<h2 class="contenthead">Coronavirus Update for Families - March 16, 2020 <span class="labels"><span class="all-label">All</span></span></h2>
				<div class="maincontent">
					<p>Dear Families,</p>
					<p>All of us are living through an unprecedented time as we work to keep our communities safe and healthy in the face of the coronavirus. New Yorkers are joining millions in cities, states, and nations across the world in confronting decisions that weâ€™ve never had to faceâ€”and maybe never could have imagined having to.</p>
					<p>Here in New York, Mayor de Blasio and I have been clear that any changes to our school system as we know it would be an extreme measureâ€”a last resort. Weâ€™ve been monitoring the outbreak in New York City day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute. This weekend, it became clear that continuing public education in our school buildings was no longer sustainable for the time being.</p>
					<p>On Sunday, we announced that for the next three and a half weeks, we are moving to a remote learning model, with a projected reopening of school buildings the week of April 20, 2020. I know this may feel abrupt, and has the potential to cause disruption in your lives. We are committed to consistent and clear communication with you throughout this time period, and a clear understanding of what will happen.</p>
					<p>Our announcement today means that Monday, March 16, school buildings are closed and students will be out of session. However, students and families can pick up medication or receive any standard medical services from Tuesday through Thursday, during regular school hours; school nurses and school based health center staff will be on site. During that time, teachers will also be expected to report to their buildings and receive full-day professional development on remote learning.</p>
					<p>Later in the week, students will begin picking up materials, including technology to participate in remote learning when needed. Additional guidance on all of this will be shared with you in the next couple of days.</p>
					<p>All throughout this week, grab-and-go breakfast will be available at the entrance of every school building from 7:30 AM â€“ 1:30 PM. Any student can pick up breakfast and lunch at any school building.</p>
					<p>On Monday, March 23, we will be opening several dozen Regional Enrichment Centers across the City, to serve the children of our Cityâ€™s first responders, healthcare workers, transit workers, and our most vulnerable populations.</p>
					<p>That Monday, we will also launch remote learning for grades K-12. I have every confidence in New York City educators and know they will rise to the occasion, and dedicate the same passion for delivering high-quality instruction remotely as they do in the classroom. We know we have the most dedicated school staff: teachers, custodians, administrators, and especially the school food workers who will be continuing to work during this time as part of a citywide meals program. More information on the launch of that program will be coming soon.</p>
					<p>I want to be clear that this is not a closure, but a transition. We will not lower our expectations for our students. We know they are hungry to learn and we will match their curiosity and passion with work-from-home materials, including distribution of devices that will support our remote-learning instructional model.</p>
					<p>There are already instructional resources available for every grade level in every subject at <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/learning/learn-at-home" target="_blank">schools.nyc.gov/learnathome</a>.</p>
					<p>We know this is a difficult time, and we are working hard to make sure our City continues to support families in every way we can. I want to assure families weâ€™re working to make this as seamless a transition as possible.</p>
					<p>Now is the time to come together to do whatâ€™s best for the health and safety of all New Yorkers. We are with you, partners in education in the greatest city in the world. We have the worldâ€™s most talented students, educators, and staffâ€”and nothing will ever change that.</p> 
					<p>We will continue to communicate with you in the coming days, and encourage you to visit our website at <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/coronavirus-update" target="_blank">https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/coronavirus-update</a> for more information and updates on this transition.</p>
					<p>Sincerely,</p>

				<div class="maincontent">
	    			<p>As per the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/coronavirus-update" target="_blank">Chancellor's communication</a>, NYCDOE schools are closed for instruction effective today through the end of the April vacation. We are currently planning on how we will support students through virtual and at-home learning over the upcoming weeks and what this new reality means for District 75 in terms of our uniqueness.</p>
					<p>Tuesday-Thursday, all staff should report to their assigned school site. Staff with multiple site assignments should follow their typical reporting schedule on each day, and Inclusion teams should report to their regularly assigned host school to engage in planning along with their general education colleagues. This time will be used to ensure that students have what they need to support instructional continuity at home beginning March 23rd.</p>
					<p>We know that this is a challenging and unprecedented time, with many questions left to be answered. We hope to obtain these answers in the upcoming days, and will pass along all information to you as it comes.Â We thank all staff for your ongoing commitment to your students, communication to your school communities, and support to your families.Â Your steadfast leadership is what assures us that we will effectively continue to serve our students during this unexpected shift in our school year.</p>
					<p>Take good care and stay well.</p>

					<p>The safety and well-being of all students and staff members at P35M: Manhattan High School remains our highest priority.  Towards that end, we are informing about a non-school related incident that took place today near our school.</p>
					<p>Out of an abundance of caution, the school was placed in a Shelter-In for approximately 15 minutes due to NYPD activity in the vicinity of our school building.  The Shelter-In was lifted after NYPD determined that there was no threat to our school building.</p>
					<p>We assure you that every precaution was taken and will continue to be taken to ensure the safety of our students and staff.  I want to thank all students and staff for their cooperation during the Shelter-In.</p>
					<p>We look forward to your continued partnership as we work together to ensure that P35M: Manhattan High School continues to provide the best and safest learning environment possible for all of its students and staff.</p>
					<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Assistant Principal Gavriel Berkovits at (212) 465-4390.</p>
