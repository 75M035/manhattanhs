				<p>It turns out that donating to public schools is actually kind of complicated. As a result, we unfortunately cannot provide a way for you to do so online at this time.</p>
				<p>However, do not despair! We are more than happy to take your money in the form of a check, made out to P.S. 035 Manhattan High School. If you deliver this check to one of our office secretaries, they'll make sure our principal gets it and puts it to good use. Otherwise, feel free to mail it to the site your child attends at the address on the bottom of this page.</p>
				<p>What will we use your hard-earned cash for? Good question. For one thing, notice that there are no advertisements on this site, so it generates no revenue on its own. Combine that with a plethora of miscellaneous expenses, from supplies, trips, school activities, etc., and you end up with a shortfall every year. Even after cutting costs to remain within our rigid budget, staff always end up paying out of pocket to create the best experience possible for our students. With your help, we can do even more.</p>
				<p>Here's what you'll get for donating:
					<ul>
						<li>Our eternal love</li>
						<li>A tax deduction (Tax ID #13-6400434)</li>
						<li>A warm, fuzzy feeling</li>
						<li>A slightly less warm, more empty wallet feeling (this'll go away faster than the other two, though, we promise)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Here's what you won't get:
					<ul>
						<li>Preferential treatment of any kind</li>
						<li><s>Extra apple slices</s> â€“ We changed our minds; we'll throw those in.</li>
					</ul>
